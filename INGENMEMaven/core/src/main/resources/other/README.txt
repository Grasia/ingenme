QUICK GUIDE
-----------

1. Install ANT utilities from http://ant.apache.org. It is a zip file which you have to unzip into some folder. A correct install will require the following environment variables to be defined
	-JAVA_HOME, it must point at a folder containing the JDK. Beware that JDK is not the same as JRE
	-ANT_HOME, it must point at the install folder of the ant.
	-PATH, it must contain the path to both the JDK binaries and ant binaries. 

2. Once installed, go to the distribution folder and write 

	ant runide

3. If you want to modify source files and rebuild a new version

	ant compile runide
